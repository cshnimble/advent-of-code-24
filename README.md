# Advent of Code 2024

This is a collection of my attempts at each day of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). All code is written in Python.

Each day has its own folder containing 3 files - 

* Solution script for part 1
* Solution script for part 2
* The given input for the day

## Requirements

You will need Python 3.7+ installed to run these scripts.

Unless explicitly specified, no extra modules will need installing.

## Running the scripts

Each script is individually executable as-is.
